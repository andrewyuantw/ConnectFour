# MonteCarloConnectFour

### About

I decided to create this because I always got beaten in a game of ConnectFour. I was interested in Machine Learning and how something like AlphaGo operates. I took a similar approach, but due to ConnectFour's more simplistic rules, I was able to create something fairly simply that could still give you the best move for any given board.

### How It Works

My initial idea was to code up the rules for ConnectFour, and have the computer play numerous randomized games against itself.
